# Introduction to Docker:

Docker is a very popular and powerful open-source containerization platform that is
used for building, deploying, and running applications. 
Docker allows you to decouple the application/software from the underlying infrastructure.

# What is a Container?

A container is a standard unit of soware bundled with dependencies so that
applications can be deployed fast and reliably b/w different computing platforms.

Docker can be visualized as a big ship (docker) carrying huge boxes of products
(containers).

Docker container doesn’t require the installation of a separate operating
system. 
Docker just relies or makes use of the kernel’s resources and its
functionality to allocate them for the CPU and memory it relies on the kernel’s
functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory, and separate
namespaces to isolate the application’s view of the OS (operating system).
